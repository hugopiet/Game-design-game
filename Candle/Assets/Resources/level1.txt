Level 1

Long ago, Mister Blob Flintstone, a courageous Homo erectus, was the first to discover the secret of fire. In an age of cold and darkness, his spark ignited warmth, light, and hope for all of humanity.

Now, many generations later, Mister Blob's descendant embarks on a bold journey to recreate the legendary flame that changed the world. Will he succeed in rekindling the fire of his ancestor and reclaim the lost legacy of the First Fire Maker?

Your mission is to find the flint stones and bring them back to the fireplace where your adventure begins. Along the way, you’ll climb over trees and explore a small cave. Inside, you’ll encounter a timed challenge: interact with the button to open a pathway, but be quick! The door will close if you don’t make it to the other side in time.
