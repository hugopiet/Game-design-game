Level 10

Long ago, Mr. Blob Armstrong became the first to set foot on the moon, changing history with his courage and vision.

Now, Mister Blob embarks on the same journey, but first he must find the missing top of his rocket to continue his ancestor’s legacy and reach the stars.

Your mission is to find the missing top of the rocket and return it to prepare for liftoff. Along the way, you’ll need Gnist’s assistance - burn ropes to operate cranes and rise to new heights with the hot air balloon. But watch out for the clouds - they’ll push you back if you’re not careful!
